<h2>Challenges we ran into:-</h2>
Since we had taken a very broad topic , we found it difficult to generalize the model as in selecting features, training the model and correlating parameters.<br>
The task of narrowing it down to one particular domain was bit difficult.<br>
The problem of integrating the components was really hectic. The ' dash python ' library and the 'flask' library were not supporting on our machines and hence had to think for another strategy.
